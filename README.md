# Speech Recognition

This piece of code has been implemented from this [link]<https://towardsdatascience.com/speech-recognition-with-timestamps-934ede4234b2>.

Place the audio files you want to extract text from inside the `audio` folder. Run the code inside `word_timestamps.ipynb`, and the results will be saved in a text file in the `text` folder.
